# MyCooking-android
This is my first android app.
Features:
  - It shows the recent added food, food list, and favorite food list.
  - Click on a food image will show the detail such as name, image and recipe.
  - It allows to edit the recipe, check or uncheck favorite food and the favorite food list will update the list.
What I learned:
  - basic SQLite such as create table, insert, update, query.
  - basic android studio features.
  - compressed images for app's performance
